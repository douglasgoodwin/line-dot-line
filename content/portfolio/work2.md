She Look Good challenges the singular masculine heroic image of the fisherman.

Family life provides the supportive structure of the film as it encompasses place, history, and the intimate details of a socioeconomic structure that the industry itself is rooted in. By including glimpses of familial and especially feminine influences, the film opens up a discourse about labor and regional traditions. Through descriptive filmmaking, and a privileged access to the fishing community, the film treats both work and family in an intimate way.

> “I was also impressed with Carly Short’s maritime reverie She Look Good, a collection of vignettes shot in the coastal town of Scituate, Massachusetts. The film concludes with a sailor deftly plaiting a little girl’s hair, an image rhymed to earlier scenes of nets being mended at sea, which encapsulates the film’s overall theme—how in the life of a fishing village the strong polarities of sea and land, harbor and hearth, define themselves through the other’s absence.”
